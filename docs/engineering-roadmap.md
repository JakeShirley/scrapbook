# Engineering Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-05-17_

This document turns the product roadmap into an execution tracker for engineers and future LLM agents. Keep it current as implementation lands so the next useful task is obvious without rediscovering project intent.

Related context: [docs/product-roadmap.md](product-roadmap.md)

## Current Snapshot

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local Git repo | `Done` | Repository exists on `main`. |
| Product roadmap | `Done` | Product, API, auth, GitHub, Docker, and release direction documented. |
| Engineering roadmap | `In progress` | Tracks implementation status as application engineering begins. |
| Application code | `In progress` | Validated monorepo scaffold, starter API, SQLite persistence/storage foundation, email/password auth endpoints, config package, API contract package, domain package, test utilities, authenticated web shell, asset upload/library flow, page document model, page CRUD API, basic editor flow, non-destructive photo editing metadata/controls, scrapbook embellishment layers, ordered book management, and PNG/JPEG exports exist. |
| GitHub remote | `Not started` | Local repo exists; remote setup has not been completed here. |
| CI/CD | `Done` | Pull request validation and release dry-run workflows are configured. |
| Release automation | `In progress` | semantic-release dry-run skeleton exists; publishing and GitHub Releases remain deferred. |

## Status Legend

Use these exact status values:

- `Not started`: no implementation exists yet.
- `Blocked`: cannot proceed until a named dependency or decision is resolved.
- `In progress`: active work exists in the working tree or an active branch.
- `Needs review`: implementation is ready for review or validation.
- `Done`: accepted with validation complete.
- `Deferred`: intentionally postponed.

When task status changes, update its `Status`, `Updated`, and `Notes` fields.

## Operating Rules

- Keep task IDs stable. Add new IDs instead of renumbering old ones.
- Build in order unless the user explicitly redirects the work.
- Prefer small vertical slices that leave the repo usable.
- Use Conventional Commits for commits.
- Keep checked-in package versions at `0.0.0-development`.
- Do not commit generated version bumps or generated changelog files.
- API changes must include schemas, OpenAPI updates, tests, and docs.
- Database changes must include migrations and data-safety notes where practical.
- User-owned data must be scoped by authenticated account.
- Update this file in the same PR as implementation work when practical.

## Recommended Build Order

1. Make the initial technical decisions.
2. Scaffold the repository, tooling, configuration, CI, and release skeleton.
3. Build the API contract, server shell, persistence, and storage.
4. Build accounts and authentication before user-owned product data.
5. Build the authenticated web app shell.
6. Build photo upload and the asset library.
7. Build the page document model and basic editor.
8. Add non-destructive photo editing.
9. Add books and facing spread workflow.
10. Add print and digital exports.
11. Harden the product with tests, accessibility, maintenance, and reliability.
12. Publish through GitHub Releases and GHCR.

## Definition Of Done

A task is `Done` only when applicable validation is complete:

- Code or docs are committed to the agreed branch.
- Formatting, linting, typechecking, and relevant tests pass.
- API behavior is represented in the OpenAPI contract.
- User data ownership and authorization are tested where relevant.
- Configuration and operational docs are updated when behavior changes.
- No secrets, local user data, generated version bumps, or generated changelogs are committed.

## Phase E01: Initial Decisions

Goal: settle enough decisions to scaffold without over-designing.

| ID | Task | Status | Depends on | Deliverable | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E01.1 | Choose initial API framework | `Done` | Product roadmap | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | Hono chosen; decision covers OpenAPI generation, uploads, testing, and Docker runtime. |
| E01.2 | Choose schema and OpenAPI tooling | `Done` | E01.1 | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | Zod and `@hono/zod-openapi` chosen for runtime validation and OpenAPI generation. |
| E01.3 | Choose SQLite query layer | `Done` | Product roadmap | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | Drizzle chosen; decision covers migrations, type inference, and SQLite test ergonomics. |
| E01.4 | Choose web scaffold/router | `Done` | Product roadmap | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | Vite, React, and React Router chosen for SPA behavior, Docker serving, and API separation. |
| E01.5 | Choose initial auth sequence | `Done` | Product roadmap | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | Email/password starts first; passkeys and native token flow are deferred until session foundation exists. |
| E01.6 | Choose editor spike candidates | `Done` | Product roadmap | `docs/architecture-decisions/0001-initial-application-stack.md` | `tldraw`, Konva, and Fabric.js are initial spike candidates. |

## Handoff Notes For Future LLM Sessions

- Start by reading this file and [docs/product-roadmap.md](product-roadmap.md).
- Run `git status --short` before editing.
- Pick the earliest `Not started` task whose dependencies are complete unless the user asks otherwise.
- If implementation has started, inspect the relevant package before assuming structure.
- Update this roadmap when a task materially changes state.
- Run the validation commands that exist at that point in the project.
- Mention any validation that could not run because the tooling has not been created yet.

## Current Next Actions

1. `E06.4`: Add CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated writes.
2. `E06.5`: Add session list and revocation endpoints.
3. `E13.1`: Validate and extend the production Docker image for web/API release publishing.
